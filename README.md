Synopsis
--------

jekyll-compass is a jekyll plugin that provides an interface between Jekyll's building commands and the Compass
libraries to automatically build your Compass SASS files during a regular website build. This means your CSS files
end up directly in your `_site` output folder and never need to be checked into your version control.

Installation
------------

This plugin has a very simple two step install:

1.  Install the gem:

        gem install jekyll-compass

2.  Add the gem to your jekyll website's `_config.yml` file:

        gems:
        - jekyll-compass

Usage
-----

Simply setup your SASS files in the `_sass` folder in your websites root folder. Then run `jekyll build` and watch the
magic.
